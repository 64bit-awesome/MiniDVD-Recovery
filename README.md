# MiniDVD-Recovery
Hey, do you have unfinalized miniDVDs created with Sony/Cannon camcorders?

This repository aims to consolidate information on how to extract the footage from such DVDs without commercial software. \
It will also hold tools and scripts to make the process easier.

Checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/64bit-awesome/MiniDVD-Recovery/wiki) to get started. :partying_face:
