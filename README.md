# MiniDVD-Recovery / Extraction
Hey, do you have unfinalized miniDVDs created with Sony/Canon camcorders?

There's not a lot of information out there; \
other than to try to use paid commercial software like [ISOBuster](https://www.isobuster.com/) and [CDRoller](https://www.cdroller.com/).

This repository aims to consolidate information on how to extract the footage \
**without paying for commercial software**.

It will also hold tools and scripts to make the process easier.

Checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/64bit-awesome/MiniDVD-Recovery/wiki) to get started. :partying_face:
